"Text-File-comparator" 

This utility was made only with functional programming using Python. 

It is designed to compare two specific files from pre-calibration and post calibration for two specific units.
It will compare the values that need to be within a certain tolerance for the two files and then create a report.

This is my first ever attempt to make a utility with a GUI using TKinter, hence may be very wrong for certain things.
